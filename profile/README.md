Envelop is a flexible cross-chain tool set able to give any NFT new functionality (economic set-up, on-chain royalties, rental mechanism, time/value/event-locks), protection of devaluation and anti-fraud system. 

Our long term aim is cross-chain tokenization of payment channels (rollups) to intensify unused liquidity.

Envelop consists of three parts:
1) Protocol to add the digital assets inside NFTs and set new features;
2) Oracle to score the collateral and assess the quality of assets inside NFTs;
3) Index to hedge the position to whole NFT market â€” becomes one of the first decentralised and collateralised simultaneously market indices for NFT and related assets.
